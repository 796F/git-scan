    "body": "Currently, multitouch (e.g., two finger pinch) gestures trigger 'start', 'update' and 'end' events on the TouchSync. This places a large burden on the developer to parse event data in order to achieve expected behavior. This problem is exacerbated if the developer desires to have both a TouchSync and PinchSync attached to a surface. Take the example of a developer wanting to 'drag' an surface using the TouchSync and to scale it using the PinchSync. Every time the user pinches, both those touches are going to be piped into the TouchSync causing the surface to move in erratic ways. Every developer trying to implement this common case would need to parse the data.identifier in order to adjust for only one touch input. A simpler solution is to only have the TouchSync map to one finger gestures (and if a developer wants to move an item with a two finger gestures they can do so by using the data.center attribute passed through the PinchSync.)\r\n\r\nThis PR updates TouchTracker to:\r\n1.) Only emit 'start'/'update' events if there is a single touch\r\n2.) Only emit 'end' events if 'start' was previously triggered by a single touch.\r\n ",

    "body": "The current FastClick implementation matches events based on the event target. This doesn't work for my app because at the point of time the click event finally fires an animation has already played thus the click **event hits a different target** and it won't get canceled properly. I propose doing the matching based on the position. That's more reliable in the typical animation heavy famo.us app.\r\n\r\nFor those who have concerns that this isn't strict enough anymore, here's the deal: The worst thing that can happen is that the event for a legit click gets canceled that happened within the first 500ms after a touch in a only 70px wide box around it. This half second isn't even enough time to grab the mouse properly :)",

If desired, they can be split up and issued as separate pull requests.\r\n\r\n##### Double eventing on MouseDrag 6d27f97 \r\nIf you had a mouse drag starting on an element, left the element, and passed over it again, it would trigger another mouseleave event. Without this fix, multiple event listeners would be attached to document.body, causing the event to be fired many times. \r\n\r\n##### Unstable Velocity 1e12fea & 6d3b38b\r\nPreviously, velocity was only the delta between the current frame and the last. This led to very inconsistent velocity values. By taking the delta from 10 frames back, the velocity values are much more stable. It also eliminates the possibility of receiving a random [0,0] velocity return, which was the main issue we ran into. \r\n\r\nDoing some pretty basic testing, and dragging as smoothly as possible in an upwards right angle, the average variability between each velocity delta is below. \r\n```js\r\nWith frame delay\r\n0.5696997600166982% \r\n3.0226436369485223%\r\nWithout \r\n5.7359798910147836%\r\n5.66135823561128 %\r\n```\r\n\r\n@michaelobriena ",

Otherwise the _final* states do not represent the actual final states, but the final states of the previous (unfinished) transformation. This results into unexpected behavior when doing a single transformation (e.g. rotation) on a halted TransitionableTransform that didn't update its final states, since the _buildFinal uses the _final* of each Transformation (which hasn't been updated).",

This will detect the need for vendor prefixes to reduce the total number of DOM hits on perspective change\r\n- Context was including an invalid value on non-prefixed perspective style declarations (`1000` instead of `1000px`\r\n\r\nThis will solve all of that",

    "body": "Solves: https://github.com/Famous/core/issues/7\r\n\r\nThere are times when developing Famo.us apps that the developer knows they are completely done with content generated in Famo.us. For those times, it is desired to have the ability to remove items from the scene graph, including complete removal from Entity. \r\n\r\nOther than custom event cleanup, this pull request would enable developers to permanently remove items from a Context, View, or RenderNode directly.\r\n\r\nexample:\r\n```js\r\nvar myView = new View();\r\nvar someSurface = new Surface();\r\nmyView.add(someSurface);\r\n\r\n// at a later point\r\nmyView.remove(someSurface) // surface removed from the render tree and unregistered from entity\r\n```\r\nIf you have a parent with multiple children, all nested entities are unregistered and removed. All deregistering / entity cleanup happens immediately.\r\n\r\nThe remove method is tested with Mocha in [this repo.](https://github.com/timjchin/removalTesting)\r\nCurrently tested:\r\n```\r\nBFS   \r\nOne level   \r\nshould find a single level surface   \r\nshould find a single level modifier   \r\nshouldn't find a node not included in the tree   \r\n\r\ndeep level   \r\n\r\nshould find a nested surface.   \r\nshould find a nested modifier.   \r\nshould find a surface inside of a view   \r\nshould find a surface inside of a view inside of a view   \r\nshould find a surface inside of a view inside of a view inside of a view..   \r\n\r\nRemoval   \r\n\r\nshould remove a nested surface.   \r\nshould unregister a nested surface from Entity.   \r\nshould remove a portion of the render tree.   \r\nshould remove a portion of the render tree inside of a view.   \r\nshould remove a portion of the render tree inside of a view. Multiple surfaces.   \r\nshould remove a portion of the render tree inside of a view. Multiple surfaces inside nested Views.   \r\nshould unregister the portions of the render tree that were removed.   \r\n\r\nRemove From Live Famo.us   \r\n\r\nshould remove a surface.   \r\nshould remove a portion of the render tree.   \r\nshould remove a portion of the render tree.   \r\n```\r\n\r\nRequired Changes\r\nRenderNode is aware of it's parent. This allows faster traversal up the tree, all the way to the Context it is attached to. \r\nRenderNode has an ID.\r\n\r\nThis implementation of remove supports Views, Modifiers, Surfaces, or items that have a renderNode as `._node`. As a caveat, components like HeaderFooterLayout would not be supported with complete cleanup. They could gain support if they conform to the View pattern of having one parent renderNode aliased as  `._node`. Similar components could be refactored to support that pattern.",
