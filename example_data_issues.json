      "body": "Currently, multitouch (e.g., two finger pinch) gestures trigger 'start', 'update' and 'end' events on the TouchSync. This places a large burden on the developer to parse event data in order to achieve expected behavior. This problem is exacerbated if the developer desires to have both a TouchSync and PinchSync attached to a surface. Take the example of a developer wanting to 'drag' an surface using the TouchSync and to scale it using the PinchSync. Every time the user pinches, both those touches are going to be piped into the TouchSync causing the surface to move in erratic ways. Every developer trying to implement this common case would need to parse the data.identifier in order to adjust for only one touch input. A simpler solution is to only have the TouchSync map to one finger gestures (and if a developer wants to move an item with a two finger gestures they can do so by using the data.center attribute passed through the PinchSync.)\r\n\r\nThis PR updates TouchTracker to:\r\n1.) Only emit 'start'/'update' events if there is a single touch\r\n2.) Only emit 'end' events if 'start' was previously triggered by a single touch.\r\n ",

This doesn't work for my app because at the point of time the click event finally fires an animation has already played thus the click **event hits a different target** and it won't get canceled properly. I propose doing the matching based on the position. That's more reliable in the typical animation heavy famo.us app.\r\n\r\nFor those who have concerns that this isn't strict enough anymore, here's the deal: The worst thing that can happen is that the event for a legit click gets canceled that happened within the first 500ms after a touch in a only 70px wide box around it. This half second isn't even enough time to grab the mouse properly :)",

Without this fix, multiple event listeners would be attached to document.body, causing the event to be fired many times. \r\n\r\n##### Unstable Velocity 1e12fea & 6d3b38b\r\nPreviously, velocity was only the delta between the current frame and the last. This led to very inconsistent velocity values. By taking the delta from 10 frames back, the velocity values are much more stable. It also eliminates the possibility of receiving a random [0,0] velocity return, which was the main issue we ran into. \r\n\r\nDoing some pretty basic testing, and dragging as smoothly as possible in an upwards right angle, the average variability between each velocity delta is below. \r\n```js\r\nWith frame delay\r\n0.5696997600166982% \r\n3.0226436369485223%\r\nWithout \r\n5.7359798910147836%\r\n5.66135823561128 %\r\n```\r\n\r\n@michaelobriena ",

      "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI somehow have problems adding many modifiers/surfaces to a context in Chromium/Chrome. First thought I have a bug somewhere in my code but after hours of debugging and not finding anything wrong I realized that it works perfectly fine in Firefox.\r\n\r\nI created a simplified version to reproduce the problem which can be seen here:\r\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/janober/aLyfxzws/\r\n\r\nIf I run it in Firefox it displays me 1-20 like it should.\r\nBut if I run it in Chromium it just displays me: 9-20\r\nIn Chrome it also displays me 1-20 but makes problems as soon as I change the loop to a higher value. So from 20 to 40 for example. Then it suddenly just displays me 7-40. In Firefox I was not able to reproduce that problem at all.\r\n\r\nHope that is helpful and the bug can be fixed.\r\n\r\nJust in case. I run Ubuntu 14.04 and use\r\nChromium: Version 36.0.1985.125 Ubuntu 14.04 (283153)\r\nChrome: Version 36.0.1985.143\r\nFirefox: 31.0c\r\n\r\nThanks & blue skies",

On some mobile phones, this works as expected. Sadly, not on all phones.\r\n\r\nOn a test Huawei, when clicking the icon with state 0, the menu shows and instead of staying visible, it hides itself. The same behaviour occurs when holding the icon with state 1. This leads me to believe that it receives multiple events. The first of these would cause the menu to open, and the second would cause it to close.\r\n\r\nSo I tested this theory and commented out the mouse sync from the generic sync and as I suspected, the Huawei had no more issues. I have also tested this on the iOS Simulator, which gave me the exact same behaviour.\r\n\r\nIt therefore seems that on some phones, both mouse and touch events are emitted from a generic sync if the user touches the screen.",
